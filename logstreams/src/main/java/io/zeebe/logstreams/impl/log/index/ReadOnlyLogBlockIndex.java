 * Block index, mapping an event's position to the physical address of the block in which it resides

 * <p>Each Event has a position inside the stream. This position addresses it uniquely and is
 * assigned when the entry is first published to the stream. The position never changes and is
 * preserved through maintenance operations like compaction.
 *
 * <p>In order to read an event, the position must be translated into the "physical address" of the
 * block in which it resides in storage. Then, the block can be scanned for the event position
 * requested.
